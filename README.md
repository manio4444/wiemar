## Troubleshooting


### ps_emailalerts:

**When there is error - mails is subscribed already (savins from product page):**

Look in debug mode for XHR response, probably table is missing:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ps_mailalert_customer_oos` (
  `id_customer` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `customer_email` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  `id_product` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `id_product_attribute` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `id_shop` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `id_lang` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id_customer`,`customer_email`,`id_product`,`id_product_attribute`,`id_shop`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```


**When email is beeing remove from ```ps_mailalert_customer_oos``` but mail not send:**

Probably there is missing folder with tranlation in module folder:
```
/production/modules/ps_emailalerts/mails
```

Just copy whole ```en``` folder into ex. ```pl```
